Project Title: Exploring core abiotic stress responses in *Zea mays* through meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data.

Background: Abiotic stressors such as drought, salt, flooding, cold, heat, and low nitrogen are major constraints on agricultural productivity, including that of maize (*Zea mays*), one of the most important global crops. Gene expression changes under these stress conditions have been extensively studied, leading to a large amount of publicly available RNA-sequencing data for stress-treated maize. In this project, I seek to leverage these public data to explore conserved gene expression responses to the six stressors listed above: the core stress response.
